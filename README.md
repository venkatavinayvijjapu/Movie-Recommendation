Usage

The project includes two main files:

**Deployement.py:** 
A deployement using streamlit. where the command to run is 
streamlit run app.py

**movie_recommender_notebook.ipynb:**
A Jupyter Notebook that walks through the process of using the MovieRecommender class and provides some example recommendations.
You can run the script from the command line by specifying the path to the input file (a CSV file containing movie ratings data) and the user ID for whom you want to generate recommendations:


**Dataset:**
The movie ratings data used by this project is a sample of the MovieLens dataset. The original dataset contains over 27 million ratings for over 58,000 movies, but for the purposes of this project, we have limited the data to a smaller sample.
Here we had used tbmd data from kaggle:

As the data and pkl files are of large size so it is preferred to run in your local host
