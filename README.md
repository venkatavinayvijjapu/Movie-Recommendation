Welcome to the Movie Recommendation Project! This project is designed to help users find the best movie recommendations based on their preferences.

# Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher

Pipenv

Jupyter Notebook (optional)

# Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

# shell
Copy code

$ git clone https://github.com/venkatavinayvijjapu/movie-recommendation.git
$ cd movie-recommendation
Create a virtual environment with Pipenv and install the dependencies:

Copy code
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
Usage
The project includes two main files:

* Deployement.py:* A script that contains the MovieRecommender class, which can be used to generate movie recommendations for a user.
movie_recommender_notebook.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that walks through the process of using the MovieRecommender class and provides some example recommendations.
You can run the script from the command line by specifying the path to the input file (a CSV file containing movie ratings data) and the user ID for whom you want to generate recommendations:

css
Copy code
$ python movie_recommender.py --input_file path/to/ratings.csv --user_id 123
Alternatively, you can open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells to see the process and example recommendations in action.

Data
The movie ratings data used by this project is a sample of the MovieLens dataset. The original dataset contains over 27 million ratings for over 58,000 movies, but for the purposes of this project, we have limited the data to a smaller sample.
